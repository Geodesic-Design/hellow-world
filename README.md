I JUST MIGHT BR GETTING THIS. IT HAS TAKEN FOREVER TO GET HER. 
THE FIRST TIME I TRYED TO GET THIS THING INTO A FORMULA I COULD USE. i got it on a 48k apple II plus. it worked tho it was just the cord factor it was a start. The next incarnation of the geodesic design came in the form of an Amiga A2000 I loved that little machine. it worked on a lot of open shared files too.the small engeniering job I ked on that  gave burth to a much easer program to opperate.I found the hard copy of that, I developed, way back when way back when. Because I have the tendencies of a pack rat. I still have that coad as a guide.
another step.
